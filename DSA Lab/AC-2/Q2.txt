You are tasked with managing a payroll system for a small company. 
The company needs to calculate the net pay of employees based on their 
gross pay, with additional allowances for travel and dearness. 
You are given a C program that defines an Employee structure and calculates 
net pay. However, there are some errors and inefficiencies in the provided code.

Tasks:
Identify and Fix Errors:

Identify and fix all errors in the provided code.
Explain why each error occurs and how you fixed it.
Time and Space Complexity:

Analyze the time complexity of the calculateNetPay function.
Analyze the space complexity of the calculateNetPay function.
Conceptual Questions:

What is the purpose of the Employee structure in the code?
Describe how the calculateNetPay function computes the net pay.
Why is it important to use correct format specifiers in scanf and printf?
Edge Cases and Testing:

What are some edge cases you should consider while testing this program?
How would you handle invalid inputs for empID, empNME, and Grosspay?
Optimization:

Suggest any potential optimizations or improvements for this code.
Explain how these changes could improve the performance or correctness of the program.
Deliverables:
Corrected Code:
Provide the corrected version of the code with comments explaining the changes.

Complexity Analysis:
Provide detailed explanations for the time and space complexity analyses.

Conceptual Answers:
Answer the conceptual questions based on your understanding of the code and its functionality.

Edge Cases:
List at least three edge cases and explain how they affect the program. Provide code or strategies for handling these cases.

Optimization Suggestions:
Provide and explain your suggestions for optimizing the code.
